# Personal Dataset Project

# Motivation
For the purposes of this personal data set project, I have analyzed data sets from the United States FBI of violent crimes in approximately the previous 60 years, versus the number of firearm licenses present in the United States in the same timeframe. It would commonly be expected that as the number of gun licenses increases, the frequency of violent crimes would increase. For the purposes of this project, we will only focus on these two factors, but in general it is important to note that correlation does not always equal causation. In 2021, guns are currently a “hot topic”, which is what lead me to be curious if the data would fit the mainstream narrative in regards to guns. In the crime data set, the total violent crimes include murder, rape, assault, robbery, and burglary.

# Data Process
I downloaded the data from each of their designated sources, then transposed the data in Excel so the format was easier to work with. I then noticed there were many blank/white spaces in the dataset, so I used the Find & Replace function in excel to remove those. In order to calculate correlation in the analysis portion, I combined the data from the Crime Statistics with the Firearm Licenses in the GvC Excel Workbook. Once I was satisfied with the datasets, and scanned for obvious errors/typos, I uploaded the data as a .csv file to RStudio to begin my analysis. 

# Data Sources
-The violent crime statistics were retrieved from the FBI website.
-The firearm licenses, deaths, and background check statistics were received from USA Facts website.
